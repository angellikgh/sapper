question: How do I use TypeScript with Sapper?
---

The Sapper template project with Rollup (see [Getting started](/docs#Getting_started)) can be converted to TypeScript by running:

```bash
node scripts/setupTypeScript.js
```

You can also find a number of [community templates](https://github.com/sveltejs/integrations#sapper-templates-boilerplates) that utilize TypeScript.
