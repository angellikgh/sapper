question: Sapper is not 1.0 yet. Should I use it? What about SvelteKit?
---

Sapper has been deprecated in favor of it's successor, [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). Please see the [migration guide](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/migrating) for details on how to migrate to SvelteKit.

Sapper and SvelteKit are operationally stable and some of the Svelte maintainers run their businesses on them. However, there will be breaking API changes before 1.0. "production readiness" is subjective, and if your requirements are fulfilled, then it's production ready. As with any software, a major version number is not an indicator of whether something is suitable for your specific use-case.
