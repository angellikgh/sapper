question: Sapper is not 1.0 yet. Should I use it? What about SvelteKit?
---

We are currently working on Sapper's successor, [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). There are still some known issues to resolve and aspects of the design that will change. Whether you want to start on SvelteKit will be determined by how willing you are to deal with bumps in the road during a beta period. If you want to evaluate starting on the more stable Sapper project and then migrating to SvelteKit, please see the [migration guide](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/migrating) for details of what's necessary to do that.

Sapper is operationally stable and some of the Svelte maintainers run their businesses on Sapper. "production readiness" is subjective, and if Sapper fulfils your requirements, then it's production ready. As with any software, a major version number is not an indicator of whether something is suitable for your specific use-case.
