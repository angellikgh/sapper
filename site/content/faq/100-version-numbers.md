question: Sapper is not 1.0 yet. Should I use it? What about SvelteKit?
---

[We are currently working on Sapper's successor called SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit). No documentation or support is offered for SvelteKit yet, so if you're starting a new project, we recommend using Sapper for now. For the most part, it should be relatively straightforward to migrate a Sapper codebase to SvelteKit.

Sapper is operationally stable and some of the Svelte maintainers run their businesses on Sapper. "production readiness" is subjective, and if Sapper fulfils your requirements, then it's production ready. As with any software, a major version number is not an indicator of whether something is suitable for your specific use-case.
