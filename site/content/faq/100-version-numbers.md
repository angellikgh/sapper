question: Sapper is not 1.0 yet. Is it production ready and should I use it?
---

The version number reflects that there are major features we'd like to add still. E.g. TypeScript support was added in Sapper 0.28.

Sapper is operationally stable and some of the Svelte maintainers run their businesses on Sapper. "production readiness" is subjective, and if Sapper fulfils your requirements, then it's production ready. As with any software, a major version number is not an indicator of whether something is suitable for your specific use-case.
